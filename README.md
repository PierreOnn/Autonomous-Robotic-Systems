# Autonomous Robotic Systems

This project entails swarm intelligence, evolutionary algorithms and localization within a robot environment.
The evolutionary algorithm is based upon a fitness function so that as much area is covered between the walls.
The localization implements kalman filters to track the position of the robots by the landmarks.

Controls for the robot are:
- W to increase speed of left wheel
- S to decrease speed of left wheel
- O to increase speed of right wheel
- L to decrease speed of right wheel
- T to increase speed of both wheels
- G to decrease speed of both wheels
- X to put speed of both wheels to 0
